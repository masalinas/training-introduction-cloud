    <p>When provisioning Amazon EC2 instances, users are able to manage different instance aspects, such as hardware profile, operating system image with software package, additional storage, the network attached to the instance, and firewall rules.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html" target="_blank">Amazon Machine Images</a>&nbsp;(<strong>AMI</strong>) are preconfigured images with the information needed to launch EC2 instances. They include an Operating System and a collection of software packages. AMIs are stored in an AWS repository and are used to quickly launch instances. There are default images created and maintained by AWS, the user community, or custom images we can create ourselves.</p>
    <p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html" target="_blank">Instance Types</a>&nbsp;determine the virtualized hardware profile of the instance to be launched. Each instance type is preconfigured with different compute, memory, and storage capabilities. They are categorized in instance families such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <ul>
    <ul>
    <li>General purpose instances</li>
    <li>Optimized instances for:</li>
