Its cloud services, whether Platform, Software, DB, Containers, Serverless, Machine Learning, to name a few, rely heavily on its Infrastructure. Part of Amazon's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model is the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Compute&nbsp;Cloud</a>&nbsp;(<strong>Amazon EC2</strong>) service. Amazon EC2 service allows individual users and enterprises alike to build a reliable, flexible, and secure cloud infrastructure for their applications and workloads on Amazon's platform. AWS offers an easy to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/" target="_blank">Console</a>, which is a web interface for cloud resources management.</p>
    <p>Amazon EC2 instances are in fact Virtual Machines. When provisioning EC2 instances on the AWS infrastructure, we are provisioning VMs on top of hypervisors that run directly on Amazon's physical infrastructure. In addition to the web console, AWS also offers a&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">command line interface</a> (<strong>CLI</strong>), a tool to manage resources scriptically if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At the heart of Amazon EC2 service, are various type-1 hypervisors, such as Xen, KVM, and&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/" target="_blank">Nitro</a> (a newer KVM-based lightweight hypervisor&nbsp;that delivers close to bare-metal performance).</p>
    <p>It comes with no surprise that the Amazon EC2 is a paid service, but, new users are encouraged to try the AWS platform for free through&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier-faqs/" target="_blank">AWS Free Tier</a> offering. While not all of its services qualify for the free tier, the ones that are available for free do come with some limitations. However, users are still encouraged to take advantage of the free tier offering to become familiar with the most popular services the AWS platform has to offer.</p>
