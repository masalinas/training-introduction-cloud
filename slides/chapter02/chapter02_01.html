        <p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service&nbsp;</strong>(<strong>IaaS</strong>) is a cloud service model that provides on-demand physical and virtual computing resources, storage, network, firewall, and load balancers. To provide virtual computing resources, IaaS uses hypervisors, such as Xen, KVM, VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, or Nitro.</p>
        <p>Infrastructure as a Service is the backbone of all other cloud services, providing computing resources. After the provisioning of the computing resources, other services are setup on top.</p>
        <p><em>Example:</em><br>Let's say that you want to have a set of ten Linux systems with 4GB RAM each, and two Windows systems with 8GB each to deploy your software. You can go to any of the IaaS providers and request these systems. Generally, an IaaS provider creates the respective VMs in the background, puts them in the same internal network, and shares the credentials with you, thus allowing you to access them. Other than VMs, some&nbsp;IaaS providers offer bare-metal machines for provisioning.</p>
        <p>In this chapter, we will take a closer look at&nbsp;some of the IaaS providers and their features. We will also provide&nbsp;a demo video for each one of them.</p>
