<h3>Ubuntu Core</h3>
<h5>Introduction to Ubuntu Core</h5>

<p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/core" target="_blank">Ubuntu Core</a>&nbsp;is a lightweight version of <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, predominantly designed for IoT devices but also found in large container deployments. In comparison with other container OSes, its size of around 260MB places Ubuntu Core at the top of container OSes, besting CentOS Atomic and Fedora CoreOS. Similar to Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Core works with software packages called snaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security is a top concern for the designers of Ubuntu Core, implemented by features such as:</p>
<li>Hardened security with immutable packages and&nbsp;persistent digital signatures.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Strict application isolation.</li>
<li>Reduced attack surface by keeping a small OS, stripped down to bare essentials.</li>
<li>Automatic vulnerability scanning of packages.</li>
<p>In addition, Ubuntu Core was designed with extreme reliability, implemented by:</p>
<li>Transactional updates that increase OS and data resiliency by allowing automated rollbacks when errors are encountered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Automated restore points to allow returns to the last working boot in the case of an unsuccessful kernel update.</li>
<li>Consistent application data snapshots.</li>
<p>Ubuntu Core was built for the enterprise by including secure app store management and license compliance. Developers using Core as their platform enjoy cross-platform portability of snaps from Desktop and Server to Core, together with CI/CD pipeline support and integration with Travis.</p>
