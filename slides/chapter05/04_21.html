<h3>VMware Photon</h3>
<h5>Introduction to VMware Photon</h5>

<p><a href="https://vmware.github.io/photon/" target="_blank">Photon OS™</a>&nbsp;is a minimal Linux container host provided by <a href="https://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank">VMware</a>, optimized for cloud-native applications. It is designed with a small footprint in order to boot extremely quickly on VMware vSphere deployments and on cloud computing platforms. Photon can be deployed on Amazon EC2 and GCE instances, while supporting a variety of container formats, such as Docker, rkt, and Cloud Foundry Garden.</p>
<p>Photon OS™ is available in two versions, a minimal and a full version:</p>
<li>The minimal version is a lightweight container host runtime environment including a minimum of&nbsp;packaging and functionality to manage containers while still remaining a fast runtime environment.</li>
<li>The full version also includes&nbsp;<span>packages of tools for the development, testing, and deployment of containerized applications.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
