<h3>Atomic Host</h3>
<h5>Introduction to Atomic Host</h5>

<p><a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/" target="_blank">Atomic Host</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>is a lightweight operating system, assembled out of a specific RPM content. It allows us to run just containerized applications in a quick and reliable manner in private or public clouds. </span>Atomic Host is available in three editions: Fedora Atomic Host, CentOS Atomic Host, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Atomic Host.</p>
<p>Atomic Host is the core sub-project of <strong><a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/introduction/" target="_blank">Project Atomic</a></strong>, together with other sub-projects, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://cockpit-project.org/" target="_blank">Cockpit</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle" target="_blank">Atomic Developer Bundle</a>.&nbsp;Project Atomic and its sub-projects aim to re-design the operating system around principles of immutable infrastructure, based on the LDK (Linux, Docker, Kubernetes) stack, with many components being upstream components of <a href="https://www.okd.io/" target="_blank">OpenShift Origin</a>. The project maintains and makes use of additional open source tools such as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Buildah</a>, <a href="https://kompose.io/" target="_blank">Kompose</a>, <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap" target="_blank">Bubblewrap</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">skopeo</a>.</p>
<p>Atomic Host<span>&nbsp;comes out-of-the-box with Kubernetes installed together with several Kubernetes utilities, such as&nbsp;</span><strong>etcd</strong><span>, and&nbsp;</span><strong>flannel</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>However, at the time of this writing, the Atomic Host platform is slowly being replaced with <a href="https://getfedora.org/coreos/" target="_blank">Fedora CoreOS</a>. While&nbsp;</span>Fedora is no longer building new versions of Atomic Host, but still provides updates for the Fedora Atomic Host version 29, the CentOS project plans to rebuild the RHEL 7-based versions of Atomic Host, but there is no plan for a&nbsp;version 8 of RHEL or CentOS Atomic Host.</p>
