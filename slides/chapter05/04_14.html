<h3>RancherOS</h3>
<h5>Introduction to RancherOS</h5>

<p><a href="http://rancher.com/rancher-os/" target="_blank">RancherOS</a>&nbsp;is a lightweight and secure&nbsp;Linux distribution that is made of containers to manage other containers.&nbsp;It has the smallest footprints among Micro OSes because it only includes the software needed to run Docker, while all other OS features are pulled dynamically through Docker.&nbsp;By leveraging both Docker and Kubernetes to manage containers, RancherOS makes it simple to run containers at scale in development, test, and production environments. The containerized system services of the OS provide a very reliable and easy method to manage a container-ready environment.</p>
