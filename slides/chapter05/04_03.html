<h3>Alpine Linux</h3>
<h5>Introduction to Alpine Linux</h5>

<p><a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/about/" target="_blank">Alpine Linux</a>&nbsp;is an independent, non-commercial, Linux distribution designed for&nbsp;security, simplicity and resource efficiency.</p>
<p>Although small at about 8 MB per container,&nbsp;it is more resource-efficient than typical distributions. Users can control what binary packages to install, thus ensuring a small yet efficient system.</p>
<p>Alpine Linux uses its own package manager called apk, the OpenRC init system, and set-up scripts. Users can add packages as needed such as PVR, iSCSI storage controllers, a mail server container, or an embedded switch.</p>
<p>Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind with embedded proactive security features that prevent the exploitation of entire classes of zero-day and other vulnerabilities.</p>
