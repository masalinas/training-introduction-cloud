<h3>Fedora CoreOS</h3>
<h5>Introduction to Fedora CoreOS</h5>

<p><a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/" target="_blank">Fedora CoreOS</a>&nbsp;(FCOS) is an open source project partnered with the <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/" target="_blank">Fedora Project</a>. It was formerly known as&nbsp;<a href="https://coreos.com/" target="_blank">Red Hat CoreOS</a> and CoreOS Container Linux prior to that.&nbsp;It combines the best of both CoreOS Container Linux and <a href="https://www.projectatomic.io/" target="_blank">Fedora Atomic Host</a>&nbsp;(FAH) while aiming to provide the best container host to run containerized workloads securely and at scale.</p>
<p>Fedora CoreOS is a minimal operating system for running containerized workloads, that updates automatically and is available on multiple platforms.&nbsp;Although a container-focused operating system, by design CoreOS, is operable in both clusters and standalone instances. In addition, it is optimized to work with Kubernetes but it also works very well without the containerized workload orchestrator.</p>
