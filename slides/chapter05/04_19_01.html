<h3>Ubuntu Core</h3>
<h5>Components of Ubuntu Core</h5>

<p>Ubuntu Core is designed to run on bare-metal, on hypervisors such as KVM, or a wide range of hardware including Raspberry Pi and Qualcomm Snapdragon 410c. Its top features are:</p>
<li>Immutable image for simple and consistent installation and deployment.</li>
<li>Isolated applications run with explicit permissions, such as read-only access to the filesystem.</li>
<li>Transactional updates for signed, autonomous, atomic, and flexible updates.</li>
<li>Security implemented at snap level, from build and distribution to deployment.</li>
<p>Application security and isolation is implemented through:</p>
<li>AppArmor</li>
<li>Seccomp.</li>
<p>Snaps are secure, isolated, dependency-free, portable, software packages for Linux. They even include their own filesystems. Snaps benefits include:</p>
<li>Automatic updates.</li>
<li>Automated recovery in the case of failed updates.</li>
<li>Critical update provision for unscheduled updates.</li>
<li>Flexible hardware and network conditions support for unpredictable systems, including redundancy for roll-backs, and autonomous bootstrapping.</li>
