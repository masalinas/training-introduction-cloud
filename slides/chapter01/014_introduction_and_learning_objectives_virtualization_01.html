    <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>,</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 25.6px;"><em>"In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and computer resources".&nbsp;</em></span></p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;">Virtualization can be achieved at different hardware and software layers, such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), storage (disk), memory (RAM), filesystems, etc. In this chapter, we will explore a few tools that allow us to create Virtual Machines (VMs) after emulating essential hardware components that support the installation of a guest Operating System (OS) on them. A VM represents an isolated collection of emulated resources, behaving like an actual physical system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;">Virtual Machines are created with the help of a&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor" target="_blank">hypervisor</a></strong>, that runs on a host machine. The hypervisor is a piece of software capable of creating multiple isolated virtual operating environments, each composed of emulated resources that are then made available to guest systems. Hypervisors are classified into two main categories:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Type-1 hypervisor</strong> (native or bare-metal) runs directly on top of a physical host machine's hardware, without the need for a host OS. Typically, they are found in enterprise settings. Examples of type-1 hypervisors:</p>
