<h5>Key Features of Cloud Computing</h5>

<div>
    <p>Users benefit most from the following features of cloud computing:</p>
    <li><strong>Speed and Agility</strong><br>Cloud resources are provisioned with a few clicks, saving time and providing agility. They also scale up or down with ease, by increasing or decreasing the number of running instances of a particular resource as a response to current demand or based on projected future demand. An additional characteristic is elasticity, allowing some cloud resources instances to increase or decrease in size, also demand-driven.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost&nbsp;</strong><br>By reducing the up-front cost to set up the infrastructure, it allows users to focus on applications supporting the business processes. Another beneficial feature of cloud providers is a cost estimator, which assists users in better resource planning.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy Access to Resources</strong>&nbsp;<br>Users can access the cloud services from any place and device, as long as there is connectivity to the cloud service provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance&nbsp;</strong><br>All the lights-on maintenance work to keep resources up, running, and up-to-date is offloaded onto the provider, and it is no longer the user's concern.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-tenancy</strong>&nbsp;<br>Multiple users sharing the same pool of resources, which helps to drive down the costs incurred by each user.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability</strong>&nbsp;<br>Resources can be hosted in different data center locations, to provide increased reliability, resiliency, and high-availability.</li>
