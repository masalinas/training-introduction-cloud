<h5>Introduction to Cloud Computing and Technologies</h5>

    <p>Historically, the term&nbsp;<strong>cloud&nbsp;</strong>was used as a metaphor to represent the Internet, while a cloud-shaped figure depicting the Internet was used in computer network diagrams. To find out more about the origin of the cloud, you can explore its history on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#History" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud computing </strong>can be referred to as the remote allocation of resources on the cloud.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">According to&nbsp;</span><a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology)</a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">, the f</span>ormal definition of cloud&nbsp;computing is the following:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction</em>".</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cloud computing providers offer various services built on top of basic provisioning and releasing of resources. Most of these service models fall into one of the following categories:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
    <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Software as a Service (SaaS).&nbsp;</li>
    <p>We will discover service and deployment models together with key characteristics throughout the course. Cloud services providers offer web interfaces in the form of consoles and dashboards, aimed to improve the user experience on the platform and ease&nbsp;the&nbsp;building, configuration and monitoring of the desired services stack. Another benefit of the cloud service model is the&nbsp;</span>pay-as-you-go<span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;model adopted by cloud providers, allowing users to pay only for the cloud resources used during a set time frame. Such an approach to treat computing resources as a utility eliminates the need for high up-front investments in hardware, software, and specialized staff.&nbsp;</p>
