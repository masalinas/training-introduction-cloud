<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Container orchestration&nbsp;is an umbrella term that encompasses container scheduling&nbsp;and&nbsp;cluster management. Container scheduling allows us to decide on which host a container or a group of containers should be deployed. With cluster management orchestrators, we can manage the resources of cluster nodes, as well as add or delete nodes from the cluster. Some of the available solutions for container orchestration are:</p>
<li>Docker Swarm</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Mesos Marathon</li>
<li>Nomad</li>
<li>Amazon ECS.</li>
<p>In this chapter, we will provide more details on the options available.</p>
