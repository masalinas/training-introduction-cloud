<h3>Kubernetes</h3>
<h5>Introduction to Kubernetes</h5>

<p><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a></strong>&nbsp;is an Apache 2.0-licensed open source project for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications. It was started by Google in 2014, but many other companies like Docker, Red Hat, and VMware contributed to its success.</p>
<p>In July of 2015,&nbsp;<a href="https://cncf.io/" target="_blank">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>&nbsp;(CNCF), the nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the development of cloud-native applications and services and driving alignment among container technologies, accepted&nbsp;Kubernetes as its first hosted project. The IP was transferred to CNCF&nbsp;from Google.</p>
<p>Kubernetes supports several container runtimes such as Docker, CRI-O, frakti, and rkt to run containers.</p>
