<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Running containers on a single node may no longer satisfy the needs of an enterprise, where, especially in production, containerized workload needs to be managed at scale. That is how we benefit the most from containers. To run containers in a multi-host environment at scale, we need to find solutions to numerous issues, summarized below:</p>
<li>How to group multiple hosts together to form a cluster, and manage them as a single compute unit?</li>
<li>How to schedule containers to run on specific hosts?</li>
<li>How can containers running on&nbsp;one host communicate with containers running on other hosts?</li>
<li>How to provide the container with dependent storage, when it is scheduled on a specific host?</li>
<li>How to access containers over a service name, instead of accessing them directly through their IP addresses?</li>
<p><strong>Container orchestration</strong>&nbsp;tools, together with different plugins (for networking and storage), aim to address the issues mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
