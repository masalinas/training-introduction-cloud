<h5>The Kubernetes Architecture - Key Components (Part I)</h5>

<p>The key components&nbsp;of the Kubernetes&nbsp;architecture are:</p>
<li><strong>Cluster</strong><span>&nbsp;<br>The cluster&nbsp;is a group of systems (bare-metal or virtual) and other infrastructure resources used by Kubernetes to run containerized applications.</span></li>
<li><strong>Master Node</strong><span>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp;master&nbsp;is a system that takes&nbsp;pod&nbsp;scheduling decisions&nbsp;and manages the worker nodes. Its main components are <strong>kube-apiserver</strong>, <strong>etcd</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>kube-scheduler</strong>, and <strong>kube-controller-manager</strong>&nbsp;and they coordinate tasks around container workload scheduling, deployment, scaling, self-healing, state persistence, and delegation of other tasks to worker node agents. Multiple master nodes may be found in clusters as a solution for High Availability.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Worker Node</strong>&nbsp;<br></span>A system on which containers are scheduled to run in pods. The node runs a daemon called&nbsp;<strong>kubelet</strong>&nbsp;to communicate with the master&nbsp;node by reporting node status information and receiving instructions from the master about container lifecycle management (this daemon is also found on master nodes).&nbsp;<strong>kube-proxy</strong>, a network proxy running on all nodes, allows applications running in the cluster to be accessed from the external world.</li>
