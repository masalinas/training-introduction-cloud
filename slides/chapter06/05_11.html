<h3>Docker Swarm</h3>
<h5>Docker Datacenter</h5>

<p>Docker offers a Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) solution, the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://hub.docker.com/bundles/docker-datacenter" target="_blank">Docker Datacenter</a></strong>, which is built on top of the Universal Control Plane (UCP) and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). Docker Datacenter is an enterprise container management and deployment service hosted on-premise behind a firewall or in the cloud.</p>
<p>With Docker Datacenter we can build an enterprise-class CaaS platform on-premises, as it is built on top of Docker Swarm and integrates well with Docker tools, and the Docker Registry. In addition, it provides LDAP and AD integration, monitoring, logging, and plugin support for network and storage.</p>
