<h3>Docker Swarm</h3>
<h5>Introduction to Docker Enterprise Platform</h5>

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.docker.com/ee/" target="_blank">Docker Enterprise Platform</a>&nbsp;</strong>is a Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that manages the entire lifecycle of the applications on enterprise Linux or Windows operating systems and Cloud providers. At the time of this writing, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mirantis.com/software/docker/docker-enterprise/" target="_blank">Docker Enterprise Platform</a> has been acquired by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mirantis.com/" target="_blank">Mirantis</a> and is part of their technology stack offered as-a-service. It supports Docker Swarm and Kubernetes as container orchestrators. It has the following three major components:</p>
<li><strong>Docker Engine - Enterprise<br></strong>It is a commercially supported Docker&nbsp;Engine for creating images and running Docker containers.</li>
<li><strong>Docker Trusted Registry </strong>(<strong>DTR</strong>)<br>It is a production-grade image registry designed to store images, from Docker, Inc.</li>
<li><strong>Universal Control Plane </strong>(<strong>UCP</strong>)<strong><br></strong>It&nbsp;manages the Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, it deploys applications using the CLI and GUI, and supports High Availability. UCP also provides role-based access control (RBAC) to&nbsp;ensure that only authorized users can make changes and deploy applications to your cluster.</li>
