<h3>Cloud Foundry</h3>
<h5>Cloud Foundry Application Runtime (CFAR)</h5>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/application-runtime/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry Application Runtime</a>&nbsp;(CFAR) allows developers to run applications written in any language or framework on the cloud of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CFAR includes a command-line tool that enables the interaction with the Application Runtime. It also uses <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/" target="_blank">buildpacks</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide the framework and runtime support for applications. Buildpacks are programming language-specific and include information on how to download dependencies and configure specific applications. Below are some of the languages supported by well-defined buildpacks:</p>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>.Net</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>PHP.</li>
<p>In addition to system buildpacks, developers may build new buildpacks or customize the existing ones to meet architectural requirements.&nbsp;CFAR is also responsible for the build and running phases of the application, together with incoming network traffic routing, identity management, monitoring, logging, and integration with external services.</p>
<p>As presented in the&nbsp;graphic below, the CFAR platform can manage the entire workflow and lifecycle of an application, from routing to logging. In addition, by using the Open Service Broker API, the application may be connected with&nbsp;<span>external services like databases or third-party SaaS providers.</span>&nbsp;</p>
