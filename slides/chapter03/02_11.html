<h3>OpenShift</h3>
<h5>Introduction to OpenShift</h5>

<p><a href="https://www.openshift.com/" target="_blank">OpenShift</a> is an open source PaaS solution provided by Red Hat. It&nbsp;is built on top of the container technology orchestrated by <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>. OpenShift can be deployed in the cloud or locally on a full-fledged Linux OS or on a Micro OS specifically designed to run containers and Kubernetes.&nbsp;</span></p>
