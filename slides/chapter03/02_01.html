<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p><strong>Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong>PaaS</strong>) is a cloud service model representing a class of cloud computing services that allow users to develop, run, and manage applications while concealing the tasks involved in the management of the underlying infrastructure. With PaaS,&nbsp;users are able to concentrate their efforts on building their applications, which is&nbsp;a great benefit to developers.</p>
<p>Users have a choice between managed&nbsp;and&nbsp;self-managed PaaS solutions. Users can either use managed PaaS solutions hosted by cloud computing providers like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud or deploy an on-premise PaaS as a self-managed solution, using a platform such as <a href="https://www.openshift.com/products" target="_blank">Red Hat OpenShift</a>.</p>
<p>PaaS can be deployed on top of IaaS, or, independently on VMs, bare-metal servers, and containers.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will take a closer look at&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;PaaS&nbsp;providers and their features. We will also provide&nbsp;a demo video for each one of them.</p>
