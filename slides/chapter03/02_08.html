<h3>Cloud Foundry</h3>
<h5>KubeCF</h5>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/kubecf/" target="_blank">KubeCF</a>&nbsp;is a Kubernetes native distribution of Cloud Foundry. That is a distribution of the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime (CFAR) optimized for Kubernetes. It allows developers on CFAR to also enjoy the benefits Kubernetes has to offer, just as developers using CF Container Runtime do. Thus it bridges classic features of CF available through CFAR with emerging cloud-native workload and infrastructure management offered by Kubernetes.</p>
<p>KubeCF operates in conjunction with two incubating projects of CF: Project Quarks and Project Eirini.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-quarks/" target="_blank">Project Quarks</a>&nbsp;deploys and manages built releases. It packages CFAR as containers rather than VMs, thus allowing for effortless deployments to Kubernetes. As a result, users experience reduced infrastructure capacity which translates into cost savings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-eirini/" target="_blank">Project Eirini</a>&nbsp;allows the use of Kubernetes as the underlying container scheduler for users of CFAR, with no effect on the user experience.</p>
