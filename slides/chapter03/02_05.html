<h3>Cloud Foundry</h3>
<h5>Cloud Foundry BOSH</h5>

<p>Cloud Foundry (CF) utilizes two runtimes to separately manage and run applications and containers. These are the&nbsp;<strong>Cloud Foundry </strong><strong>Application Runtime</strong> and <strong>Cloud Foundry </strong><strong>Container Runtime</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tool that manages both runtimes for CF is <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry BOSH</a>. Although it works in the background and developers may not be exposed to the runtime management tool,&nbsp;BOSH&nbsp;is a cloud-agnostic open source tool for release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of complex distributed systems.</p>
