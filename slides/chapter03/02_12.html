<h3>OpenShift</h3>
<h5>Features</h5>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">OpenShift allows developers to deploy&nbsp;</span>containerized applications. Features such as application images and QuickStart application templates allow for one-click application deployments.</p>
<p>Thanks to Kubernetes, OpenShift receives all the features offered by the container orchestration platform, such as adding or removing nodes at runtime, persistent storage, and auto-scaling.</p>
<p>OpenShift uses the&nbsp;<em>Source-to-Image</em> (<em>S2I</em>) framework that enables users to build container&nbsp;images from the source code repository allowing for fast and easy application deployments.</p>
<p>OpenShift&nbsp;integrates well with Continuous Deployment tools to deploy applications as part of the CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>Applications are managed with ease through command line (CLI) tools, web user interface (UI), and integrated development environment (IDE) available for OpenShift.</p>
