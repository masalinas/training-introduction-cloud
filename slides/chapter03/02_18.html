<h3>The Heroku Platform</h3>
<h5>Features</h5>

<p>The Heroku Platform allows users to deploy, run, and manage applications written in multiple programming languages or frameworks, from source code that may also include dependencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By encapsulating the application in a dyno, which is a lightweight and secure container, the application can be scaled based on demand.</p>
<p>Application configuration can be decoupled from the application source code, allowing for application customization based on the environment where the application is deployed. Configuration customization is achieved through <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars" target="_blank">config vars</a>, which combined with the application&nbsp;slug,&nbsp;produce a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases" target="_blank">release</a>.</p>
<p>It is a very rich ecosystem, and it allows us to&nbsp;extend the functionality of an application with <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/add-ons" target="_blank">add-ons</a>&nbsp;available in the <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons" target="_blank">Elements Marketplace</a><span>. Add-ons allow us to easily integrate our applications with&nbsp;other fully-managed cloud services such as storage, database, monitoring, logging, pipelines, email, message queue, security, and networking.</span></p>
<p>Applications deployed on the Heroku Platform can be easily integrated with Salesforce.</p>
