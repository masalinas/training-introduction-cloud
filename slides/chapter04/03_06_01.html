<h3>Containers</h3>
<h5>Container Runtimes</h5>

<p>Namespaces and cgroups have existed in the Linux kernel for quite some time, but consuming them to create containers was not easy. After Docker was launched in 2013, containers started to become mainstream. Docker hid all the complexities in the background and came up with an easy workflow to share and manage both images and containers.</p>
<p>Docker achieved this level of simplicity through a collection of tools that interact with a container runtime on behalf of the user. The container runtime ensures containers portability, offering a consistent environment for containers to run, regardless of the infrastructure. Some of the container runtimes are provided below:</p>

Most of the cloud providers and IT vendors offer support for containers. To make sure there is no vendor locking and no inclination towards a particular company or project, IT companies came together and formed an open governance structure, called <a href="https://www.opencontainers.org/" target="_blank">The Open Container Initiative</a>&nbsp;(OCI), under the auspices of <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Linux Foundation</a>. The governance body came up with&nbsp;both&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec" target="_blank">runtime</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec" target="_blank">image</a> specifications to create standards on the Operating System process and application containers. runC is the CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to these specifications.</p>
