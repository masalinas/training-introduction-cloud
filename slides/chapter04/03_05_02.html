<h3>Containers</h3>
<h5>The Container Technology: Building Blocks</h5>

<p><strong>cgroups</strong><span> <br></span><em>Control groups</em><span> are used to organize processes hierarchically and distribute system resources along the hierarchy in a controlled and configurable manner. The following cgroups are available for Linux:</span></p>
<li>blkio</li>
<li>cpu</li>
<li>cpuacct</li>
<li>cpuset</li>
<li>devices</li>
<li>freezer</li>
<li>memory.</li>
<p><strong>Union filesystem <br></strong>The Union filesystem allows files and directories of separate filesystems, known as layers, to be transparently overlaid on top of each other, to create a new virtual filesystem. An image used in Docker is made of multiple layers and, while starting a new container, we merge all those layers to create a read-only filesystem. On top of a read-only filesystem, a container gets a read-write layer, which is an ephemeral layer and it is local to the container.</p>
