<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

    <p>When multiple applications are deployed on one host, developers are faced with a challenge - how to isolate applications from one another to avoid conflicts between dependencies, libraries, and runtimes.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization" target="_blank">Operating-System-level virtualization</a>&nbsp;allows us to run multiple isolated user-space instances in parallel. These user-space instances include the application source code, required libraries, and the required runtime to run the application without any external dependencies. These user-space instances are referred to as <strong>containers</strong>. They solve the dependencies, libraries, and runtimes conflict challenges developers have been facing in the past.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will talk about containers, as well as provide details on basic Docker operations.</p>
