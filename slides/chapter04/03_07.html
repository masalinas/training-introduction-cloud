<h5>Containers vs VMs</h5>

<p>A virtual machine runs on top of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor" target="_blank">hypervisor</a>, which virtualizes a host system's hardware by emulating CPU, memory and networking hardware resources so that a guest OS can be installed on top of them. Different kinds of guest OSes can run on top of one hypervisor. Between an application running inside a guest OS and in the outside world, there are multiple layers:&nbsp;the guest OS, the hypervisor, and at times the host OS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast to VMs, containers run directly as processes on the host OS. There is no indirection as we see in VMs, which helps containers to achieve near-native performance. Also, as the containers have a very light footprint, it becomes easier to pack a higher&nbsp;number of containers than VMs on the same physical machine. However, as containers run on the host OS, we need to make sure containers are compatible with the host OS.</p>
