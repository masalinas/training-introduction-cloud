<h3>Containers</h3>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>Typically a developer's end goal to run an application is not too difficult to achieve. However, challenges are encountered with portability, when the application needs to work consistently on multiple hardware and platforms, such as the developer's laptop, VMs, data centers, public and private clouds, from the development environment all the way to production.</p>

<p>Developers prefer not to trouble themselves with the portability and consistency aspects of applications and expect the application to just work,&nbsp;regardless of the underlying platform. By using a container technology like Docker, the application and all its dependencies can be bundled in a box.</p>
