<h5>Project Moby</h5>

<p>As we know,&nbsp;a container platform like Docker runs on different platforms and architectures: bare metal (both x86 and ARM), Linux, Mac OS-X, and Windows. We can also find pre-configured&nbsp;VM images to run Docker on popular cloud infrastructures and virtualization providers.</p>
<p>From the user perspective, the experience is seamless,&nbsp;regardless of the underlying platform. However, behind the scenes, components such as the container runtime, networking, and storage are connected to ensure this high-quality experience. Open source projects like <strong><a href="https://containerd.io/" target="_blank">containerd</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/moby/libnetwork" target="_blank">libnetwork</a></strong>&nbsp;are part of the container platform and have their own release cycles and governing models. The question is, however, how can we take those individual components and build a container platform like Docker?</p>
<p><a href="https://mobyproject.org/" target="_blank">Project Moby</a>&nbsp;is the answer. It is an open source project that provides a framework for assembling different container systems to build a container platform like Docker. Individual container systems provide features such as image, container, and secret management.</p>
